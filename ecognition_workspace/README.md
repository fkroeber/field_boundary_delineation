This is the main workspace for organising three projects one for each area of interest specified in the test_data folder. If you want to commit changes to this folder please make sure to remove all .tif files in the dpr subfolder prior to pushing any commit in order to keep the total size of the workspace folder low. Also, its advisable to change the settings under the options tab to only save the most recent project state and overwrite older versions.
